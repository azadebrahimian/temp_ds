    <p>In this section, we will discuss our approach to analyzing the problem we are tasked with. As previously stated,
        we believe it is crucial to consider the question from the perspective of the past, present, and future in
        providing an effective answer. Below, we explore the more complex perspectives, those of past and future.
        <br><br>
        In our preliminary exploration of the data, we were able to make two interesting observations. The first was
        that the overwhelming majority of alumni are concentrated in the northeast USA, which is to be expected.
        Interestingly enough, a substantial number of alumni who responded to the survey hail from all across the
        country, even as far as California. These account for close to 20% of the total responses. Second, is the
        distribution of education levels. From multiple visualizations, it is clear that the majority of those who
        responded actually completed either their Bachelor&rsquo;s degree, or some variant of a Master&rsquo;s or
        Master&rsquo;s certificate.<br><br>
