    <p>We chose to prioritize the above tasks for our final visualization. Every aspect of our design is specifically
        chosen to effectively execute each of the prioritized tasks. For example, tasks 2, 3, 4, and 5 can all be
        addressed by considering the bar chart visualization, in either its past or future form. Task 1, on the other
        hand, can be consistently completed regardless of the state of the bar chart simply by viewing the current state
        of the pie chart.<br>
        Our visualization uses only area as a mark, and uses color and size as channels. These are both quintessential
        to our design, since based on the tasks we chose and the visualizations we finalized from the initial sketches,
        each of these is necessary. Another key part of the design is the switch, or button, which alternates the bar
        chart from depicting data from past alumni events and data regarding possible future events. This interactive
        element is crucial because without it, we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to effectively address all tasks regarding
        participation (or desire to participate) in alumni events.<br>
