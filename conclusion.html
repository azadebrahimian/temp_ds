        With our visualizations finished, we consider again the tasks with which we began. Simply by using the
        capabilities of the visualizations, several noteworthy observations can be made.<br><br>

        Regarding participation in past alumni events, we were surprised to see that nearly half of alumni hadn’t been
        able to participate at all. The majority of those who did manage to participate at all either made a donation or
        listed a text-box response, which we have represented as “Other”. Future event interest is far more promising,
        with a majority of alumni favoring “Sitting on Alumni Panel[s]”, and many also interested in “Fellow Mentoring”,
        “Volunteer[ing] at MPF Events” and “Facilitat[ing] Workshop[s] or Training[s]”.<br><br>

        Additionally, linking between the bar chart and pie chart indicates that while a majority of alumni are still
        connected to their respective MPF networks anyway, seven specific events (both past and future) seem to have
        positive responses from exclusively alumni who are connected to their networks. While this is generally a good
        thing, we urge users to also consider the fact that of these seven event types, only two have a response count
        that is greater than ten, and thus we only believe these top two to be significant. In order, they are: “[Being
        an] Event Planning Committee Member” (future interest, count of 20) and “Utilized MPF Staff for a Reference”
        (past event, count of 13). However, due to the relatively low counts for each of these, we cannot conclude that
        there is a correlation between interest or participation in either event type and continued connection to MPF
        networks.<br><br>

        That being said, an overwhelming majority - in fact, for all valid event types excluding the bar representing
        “Not Engaged” - of past event types had an over 80% proportion of responses from alumni still connected to their
        respective MPF networks. This trend is even more significant among possible future events, where all event types
        had over 90% of their responses come from alumni still connected to their networks. With this information in
        mind, we conjecture that there is a correlation between alumni expressing any interest or past participation at
        all, and likelihood of a maintained connection to their respective MPF networks.<br><br>
