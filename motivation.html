    <p>Our project is to analyze and provide visualizations for data that would help answer the following questions: In
        what ways are Alums engaging in the MPF experience? What are the opportunities for Alums to reconnect with the
        organization? This is a complex topic, because it forces considerations of the past, present, and even the
        future, all to be extrapolated from a limited data sample. We hope to effectively address these questions in
        such a way that will both lead to understanding of alumni involvement in the past, and how it can be used to
        project and adapt to the future.<br><br>
        At first glance, it seems the most important data with respect to our task are responses &ldquo;How have you
        engaged with MPF in the past year?&rdquo;. While simple, simply analyzing such responses seems like a
        straightforward way to gain easy insight into the present state of alumni involvement. However, considering how
        drastically circumstances have changed since early 2020, it seemed unreasonable to prioritize this as though
        nothing had changed. Rather, our analysis will focus largely on the availability of future opportunities and the
        desire of alumni to partake in those opportunities.</p>
